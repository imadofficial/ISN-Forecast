## What are the features?
As of right now (9 June, 2022) ISN Forecast Channel is capable of a 24 hour forecast (having bugs), showing celsius and fahrenheit, UV-Index and displaying AQI (AQI is in works still.)

## What services are you using?
We currently don't have that many services but my goal is to have in every country 1 weather service and embed it inside the application. But here's a list of what services that i use.

- Rest of the world (https://www.weatherapi.com/ & For AQI & Weather Alerts: https://www.qweather.com/)
- China (https://www.qweather.com/)

By using ISN Weather Channel, you agree to these companies' terms and conditions (depending on where you're located).

## Does it warn users for upcoming earthquakes?
Are you in a known earthquake sensitive area? No worries. Together with [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/) we are given the ability to warn our users for upcoming earthquakes minutes before they happen. This feature isn't baked into Forecast just yet but we're planning to add it in the near future.
