## What are the features?
As of right now (October 12th, 2021) ISN Forecast Channel is capable of extracting weather data found in various local weather companies.

## What services are you using?
We currently don't have that many services but my goal is to have in every country 1 weather service and embed it inside the application. But here's a list of what services that i use.

- Belgium: KMI (https://www.meteo.be)
- Japan: (https://global.weathernews.com)
- New Zealand (https://www.metservice.com)
- Rest of the world (https://www.accuweather.com)

By using ISN Weather Channel, you agree to these companies' terms and conditions (depending on where you're located).
