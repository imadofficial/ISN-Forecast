## What are the features?
As of right now (October 12th, 2021) ISN Forecast Channel is capable of extracting weather data found in various local weather companies.

## What services are you using?
We currently don't have that many services but my goal is to have in every country 1 weather service and embed it inside the application. But here's a list of what services that i use.

- Rest of the world (https://www.weatherapi.com/ & For AQI & Weather Alerts: https://www.qweather.com/)
- China (https://www.qweather.com/)

By using ISN Weather Channel, you agree to these companies' terms and conditions (depending on where you're located).

## Earthquake happening in your area?
No need to worry if you live in an area that is known to have earthquakes. With a collaboration with [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/), we are making it possible to notify you whenever an earthquake strikes in your area and get to safety as fast as we can.

## Then what about tsunamis?
As for tsunamis, it still won't be available for another while. Mainly because i have no idea if such API's even exist. We'll investigate into it further & update this readme whenever new information becomes available.
